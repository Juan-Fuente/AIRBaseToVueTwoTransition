# Customer Support Processes & Procedures

## Overview

- Our goal is to provide every customer worldwide with an outstanding customer experience by giving the best support possible:

  - Provide welcome emails to every customer (no matter what service they purchased.)
  - Provide onboarding training and refresher training for renewals.
  - Provide 3/6/9 month check-ins to every customer (and end-users.)
  - Provide customer support for customer questions, concerns, assistance as needed.
  - Perform customer audits at six months (to help give insight for renewal.)
  - All support reps should be able to assist customers with problems from any products.

## New Order/Renewals Procedures

Once a sales rep marks an account as Verbal Order, support is now responsible for that account.

::: tip Note
Support should not expect sales to create any tasks for them on a new account
:::

- Support will receive the automated email from SalesForce showing there is a new closed account. These should be noted, but nothing actionable is needed

- Support should run an SF report every two weeks to ensure all accounts are caught. This report shows all verbal orders, closed-won accounts by month

- Set up a Google Spreadsheet to show support tracking. This is designed to help with transparency and an overview of what needs to be done. The spreadsheet shows when calls for customers will be placed and tracked as they are complete. Delivering two-week call/welcome email 3-month/6-month/9-month check-ins

  - If support (personal preference) likes, they may also set up personal tasks in SF.

- From single MB to a full package of AWIN/FD/Forecast/MROP, all customers will be reached out to. This includes reaching out to individual end-users.

- Welcome emails (standard template to be used) should be sent. Timeframe of welcome emails does vary by-product:
  For any GoodData products, Tim will send out initial welcome emails, including contact info for support immediately.

  - For AWIN individual users, the welcome email is sent from the system immediately.
  - For in AWIN Group, support should immediately send a welcome email with credentials.

  ::: tip Note
  For GD users and individual AWIN users, support should send an additional welcome email at the 1 to 2-week mark.
  This is to keep Avweek emails down upon first signing up/renewals.
  :::

- For AWIN, checks on set up in Drupal should be conducted at activation. Support should check at the two-week mark and alert Sarah/Account team if not complete (follow up until done). Backend processing like invoicing should be followed up on if not complete at activation. 

- Three-month check-ins should be conducted for all customers. Standardized emails to be used should be sent to all end users. Calls should be placed when numbers are available.

- Audits at the 6-month check ins (starting Jan 2022) should be conducted. Support to review the SF op, look at the user list, and see what users are active in all products. Ensure these align, look at usage, and overview of any issues. Provide traffic light assessment for renewal (Red, Yellow, Green) speak with the sales rep for an action plan for the second half of their account.
